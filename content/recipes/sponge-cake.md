description: "Sponge cake is a light and fluffy cake that is typically made with just a few basic ingredients, including eggs, sugar, flour, and sometimes a leavening agent like baking powder. The cake gets its name from its sponge-like texture, which is airy and delicate. Sponge cake can be flavored with a variety of ingredients, such as vanilla, chocolate, or lemon zest, and can be served plain or with toppings like whipped cream, fresh fruit, or frosting. It is a classic dessert that can be enjoyed on its own or as a base for other desserts like trifles and layer cakes."
