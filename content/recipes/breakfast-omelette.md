### Ingredients:


- 2 eggs
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1 tablespoon butter or oil
- Optional fillings: chopped cooked ham, diced bell peppers, sliced mushrooms, diced onions, chopped fresh herbs

### Instructions:

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and black pepper until well combined.
1. Heat the butter or oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.
1. Once the butter has melted or the oil is hot, pour the egg mixture into the skillet.
1. Use a spatula to gently lift the cooked edges of the omelette and let the uncooked egg flow to the bottom of the skillet.
1. When the top of the omelette is almost set but still slightly runny, sprinkle the shredded cheese and any additional fillings on one half of the omelette.
1. Use the spatula to gently fold the other half of the omelette over the filling.
1. Let the omelette cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the filling is heated through.
1. Use the spatula to slide the omelette onto a plate and serve hot.
