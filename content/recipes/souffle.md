## Soufflé

### Ingredients:

- 4 eggs, separated
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup milk
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and pepper

### Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 1-quart soufflé dish with butter or cooking spray.
1. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and stir until smooth.
1. Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil.
1. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
1. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
1. In another bowl, beat the egg yolks until light and frothy.
1. Add the Parmesan mixture to the egg yolks and mix until well combined.
1. Fold in the beaten egg whites, gently but thoroughly.
1. Pour the mixture into the prepared soufflé dish and smooth the top with a spatula.
1. Bake the soufflé in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown.
1. Serve immediately, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.
