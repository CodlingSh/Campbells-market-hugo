## Frittata

A frittata is an Italian egg dish made by cooking eggs with various fillings in a skillet. It's versatile, delicious, and perfect for breakfast, brunch, or a quick dinner.


### Ingredients:

- 6 large eggs
- 1/4 cup milk or cream
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 onion, diced
- 1 small red bell pepper, diced
- 1 cup baby spinach
- 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
- Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)

### Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk or cream, salt, and black pepper.
1. Heat the olive oil in a 10-inch oven-safe skillet over medium heat.
1. Add the diced onion and red bell pepper to the skillet and sauté for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are tender and the onion is translucent.
1. Add the baby spinach to the skillet and cook for another minute, until wilted.
1. Pour the egg mixture over the vegetables in the skillet and stir to distribute the vegetables evenly.
1. Sprinkle the crumbled feta cheese over the top of the egg mixture.
1. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the frittata is set and lightly golden on top.
1. Remove the skillet from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
1. Use a spatula to loosen the edges of the frittata from the skillet, then slide it onto a serving plate.
1. Sprinkle with chopped parsley, if desired, and serve.
