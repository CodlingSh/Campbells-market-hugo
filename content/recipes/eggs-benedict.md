### Ingredients:

- 4 English muffins, split
- 8 slices Canadian bacon or ham
- 8 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- For Hollandaise sauce:
-    3 large egg yolks
-    1 tablespoon lemon juice
-    1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
-    Salt and cayenne pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

1. Toast the English muffins until golden brown and keep warm.
1. In a large skillet, cook the Canadian bacon or ham over medium-high heat until lightly browned, then keep warm.
1. Fill a medium saucepan with about 2 inches of water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the vinegar and a pinch of salt.
1. Crack each egg into a small cup or ramekin. Use a spoon to create a whirlpool in the simmering water, then carefully slide one egg into the center of the whirlpool. Repeat with the remaining eggs, making sure they are not touching each other. Poach the eggs for 3-4 minutes until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.
1. Remove the poached eggs with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel.
1. To make the Hollandaise sauce, whisk the egg yolks and lemon juice together in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Whisk constantly until the mixture thickens and doubles in volume, about 3-4 minutes.
1. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter, whisking constantly, until the sauce is smooth and thickened. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in salt and cayenne pepper to taste.
1. To assemble, place 2 toasted English muffin halves on each plate. Top each half with a slice of Canadian bacon or ham, then a poached egg. Spoon Hollandaise sauce over the top of each egg, then sprinkle with black pepper.

Enjoy your classic Eggs Benedict for a delicious and indulgent breakfast or brunch!
