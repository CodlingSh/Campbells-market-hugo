### Ingredients:


- 4-5 potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 4-5 eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 cup olive oil

### Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, salt, and black pepper until well combined. Set aside.
1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
1. Add the sliced potatoes and onion to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender and lightly browned, about 15-20 minutes.
1. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the potatoes and onion to the bowl with the egg mixture. Gently stir to combine.
1. Pour the potato and egg mixture back into the skillet and cook over low heat for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the bottom is golden brown.
1. Use a large spatula to flip the tortilla over and cook for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the other side is golden brown and the eggs are set.
1. Slide the tortilla onto a plate and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
