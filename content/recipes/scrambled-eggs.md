### Ingredients:

- 3 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: chopped fresh herbs, shredded cheese, diced tomatoes, or other additions of your choice

### Instructions:

1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them together until fully blended.
1. Melt the butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.
1. Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet and let them cook for about 10 seconds until they start to set around the edges.
1. Use a spatula to gently push the cooked edges towards the center of the skillet, allowing the uncooked egg to flow to the edges.
1. Continue cooking and gently stirring the eggs until they are cooked to your desired level of doneness. Remove the skillet from the heat once the eggs are just set but still slightly runny.
1. Season the eggs with salt and pepper to taste, and stir in any desired additions (such as herbs, cheese, or tomatoes).
1. Serve the scrambled eggs immediately while they're still warm.
