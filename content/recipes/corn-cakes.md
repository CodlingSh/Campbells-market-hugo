### Ingredients:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup cornmeal
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup corn kernels (fresh or frozen)
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives (optional)
- Vegetable oil or cooking spray, for cooking

### Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.
1. In a separate medium mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, buttermilk, eggs, and melted butter until smooth.
1. Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, whisking until fully combined.
1. Fold in the corn kernels and chopped chives, if using.
1. Heat a nonstick griddle or skillet over medium-high heat and lightly coat it with vegetable oil or cooking spray.
1. Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, pour the batter onto the griddle or skillet and cook until bubbles form on the surface, about 2-3 minutes.
1. Flip the corn cake over and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes.
1. Repeat with the remaining batter, adjusting the heat as needed to prevent burning.
1. Serve the corn cakes warm, garnished with additional chives or your favorite toppings.
