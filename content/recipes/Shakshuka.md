### Ingredients:

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
- 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 4-6 eggs
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

### Instructions:

1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
1. Add chopped onion and red bell pepper to the skillet and cook until they are softened, about 5-7 minutes.
1. Add minced garlic, paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper (if using) to the skillet and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently.
1. Pour the can of crushed tomatoes into the skillet and stir to combine with the onion and pepper mixture. Allow the mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes or until the sauce has thickened slightly.
1. Using a spoon, create small wells in the tomato sauce and crack the eggs directly into them. Cover the skillet with a lid and let the eggs cook until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny, about 5-8 minutes.
1. Once the eggs are cooked to your liking, remove the skillet from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with chopped parsley.
1. Serve the Shakshuka hot with crusty bread or pita on the side.
