description: "Poached eggs are a type of egg that are gently cooked in simmering water, creating a delicate and tender texture. The egg whites are set, while the yolk remains runny, making for a delicious and creamy combination. Poached eggs are often served for breakfast or brunch, either on their own or on top of toast, English muffins, or other breakfast dishes. They can also be a healthy and protein-packed addition to salads, sandwiches, and other meals."

### Ingredients:

- 4 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Toast or English muffins, for serving

### Instructions:

1. Fill a large pot with about 2-3 inches of water and bring it to a simmer over medium heat.
1. Add the white vinegar to the water and stir gently.
1. Crack each egg into a small bowl or ramekin.
1. Using a spoon, create a gentle whirlpool in the water and carefully slide the eggs, one at a time, into the center of the whirlpool.
1. Cook the eggs for 3-4 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny.
1. Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the eggs from the water and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain off any excess water.
1. Season the poached eggs with salt and pepper to taste.
1. Serve the poached eggs immediately, either on top of toast or English muffins. 

Note: You can poach eggs in advance and store them in cold water in the fridge for up to 24 hours. To reheat, place the eggs in hot water for about 1 minute before serving.
